# Profiling Float using a Buoyancy Engine
------------
## Overview
The Buoyancy Engine is a device designed to control the buoyancy of underwater vehicles such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). By adjusting its density relative to the surrounding water, the buoyancy engine allows these vehicles to ascend, descend, and maintain a desired depth in the water column. This project is aimed in building, operating, and maintaining a buoyancy engine.

## Features
- **Depth Control**: Precise control over the depth of the underwater vehicle.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimized to minimize power consumption during operations.
- **Modularity**: Designed to be easily integrated with various AUV and ROV platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for operators.
